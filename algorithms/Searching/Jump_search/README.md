# Jump_Search

Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.

For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) size m. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]ï¿½..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.

### Input Format

* Enter the size  of array(n).
* Enter the elements in sorted form of given size.
* Enter the element to be searched(x).


### Output Format

* Prints the index where x is located in the sorted array of size n.

### Sample Input
```sh
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
```

### Sample Output
```sh
3 is at index 2
```
