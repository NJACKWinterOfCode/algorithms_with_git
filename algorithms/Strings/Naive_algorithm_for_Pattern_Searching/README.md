#Naive algorithm for pattern Searching

Slide the pattern over text one by one and check for a match. If a match is found, then slides by 1 again to check for subsequent matches.


### Input Format

-Enter the text where the pattern needs to searched.
-Enter the pattern text.

### Output Format

-Returns the index where the pattern is present.

### Sample Input:
-ALGORITHMS WITH GIT
-GIT

### Sample Output:
-Pattern found at index 16

### Implemented in:

- [C](naive_algorithm_for_pattern_searching.c)
- [C++](naive_algorithm_for_pattern_searching.c)
