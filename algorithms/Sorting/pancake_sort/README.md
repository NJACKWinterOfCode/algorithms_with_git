
# Pancake Sort

This program takes an array of size **N** and sort it in increasing order in O(nlogn) time for best case and O(n*n) for worst case.
This type of sorting is used when only the flip() operation is allowed for sorting i.e reversing a subset of the array.

### Implemented in:

- [C](pancake_sort.c)  
- [Java](pancake_sort.java)
- [Python3](pancake_sort.python)
