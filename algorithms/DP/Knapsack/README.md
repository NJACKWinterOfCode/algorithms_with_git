# 0-1 Knapsack Problem 
This is the basic problem of Dynamic Programming.
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).


### Sample Input
```
Enter the value of n: 3
Enter the values one by one:
 20 30 2
Enter their weight one by one:
 12 32 33
Enter the value of W: 45

```

### Sample Output
```
Maximum: 50
